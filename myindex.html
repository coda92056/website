<h1>Hello World!!-Internal CSS</h1>
<p>Pleasure Point is the jewel of Santa Cruz, Californiaâ€™s East Side surf scene and there may be no finer name for a surf spot anywhere on the planet. The break boasts a long-peeling reef/pointbreak wave that has the variety to thrill any surfer, from hotshot up-and-comers on Formula-One level shortboards, to white-haired longboarders logging session number 50,000. Pleasure Point boasts lots of distinct takeoff spots from First Peak to 38th Ave, but the most, well, pleasant zone (at least for the longboard set) is at Second Peak, a softer-breaking section of the wave that peels for a hundred yards on the right day.uis aute irure dolor in
